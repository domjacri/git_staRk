Thank you for finding my git tutorial. This was made possible by the work and coding tutorials of Dan Quintana (github/dsquintana, twitter @dsquintana) if you are interested in learning more please visit his site and consider following him on twitter.

The first script you will be running (StatsAndPlots.R) is based on data from the tidyverse package and their pre-loaded data (starwars). Exploration of this data was adapted from Dan Quintana's "Exploring, cleaning and analysing data in R" available on Youtube.
